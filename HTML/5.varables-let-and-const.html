    <h1>There are three types of Variables</h1>
    <h2>1.Var</h2>
    <h2>2.Let</h2>
    <h2>3.Const</h2>
    <p>Variables are basically called labels which store some sort of datatype and in this var we have to overwrite the
        value and change the values of var </p>
    <p>2. in the let variable we only change the value of variable but did'nt reassign the value </p>
    <p>3.In the Const variable we are unable to change the value or reassign the value </p>
